                                        <h3>Traditions of Saudi Arabia</h3>
                                        <p>1. Ramadan<br>
                                            The holy month of Ramadan is a major highlight of the year in Saudi Arabia
                                            and is followed by numerous national holidays. During this month, most of
                                            the locals fast from dawn to dusk. Ramadan ends with the Eid-Al-Fitr
                                            holiday, where locals buy clothes and presents for each other and celebrate
                                            with family and friends.<br>
                                            2. Hajj<br>
                                            The other major highlight of the year in the country is the Hajj pilgrimage
                                            season, during which thousands of Muslim pilgrims from across the globe
                                            visit the holy city of Makkah. This pilgrimage season ends with the Eid
                                            Al-Adha holiday, where families sacrifice goats to honor Abraham’s
                                            willingness to sacrifice his son as proof of his faith in Allah.<br>
                                            3. Generosity and compassion<br>
                                            Saudis follow several age-old and highly regarded Arab traditions, including
                                            hospitality and generosity. The Saudi community greets even strangers with
                                            warm smiles and friendly gestures.</p>

                                        <h3>Architectural heritage</h3>
                                        <p>Over the centuries, Saudi Arabia’s unique cultural heritage has undergone
                                            considerable development and transformation. In the old days, the materials
                                            and designs of buildings were influenced by geography, climate, and
                                            available resources. For instance, coral from the Red Sea was used in
                                            Jeddah, and stone and red bricks were commonly used in the country’s western
                                            region. In the central areas of Saudi Arabia, adobe was preferred due to its
                                            easy availability, insulating qualities, and malleability.

                                            Nowadays, architects in Saudi use modern technology, equipment, and
                                            resources while taking inspiration from Islamic concepts and traditional
                                            building designs. This combination of the old and the new has helped
                                            establish a link between the country’s past and its future. Two of the best
                                            examples of modern architecture and traditional Islamic design blends are
                                            the King Khalid International Airport and King Saud University.

                                            Moreover, one of the most visible structures in the country is minarets. The
                                            skyline of every urban center in Saudi Arabia features multiple minarets,
                                            which symbolize the bond between Allah and the Muslim society. These
                                            minarets tower over all other surrounding buildings to allow the call of
                                            prayer to be easily heard by all those living in the mosque’s neighborhood.

                                        <p>Over the past several decades, the country has undergone a significant
                                            cultural transformation. The Saudi people have preserved their century-old
                                            customs, values, and traditions and adapted them to today’s contemporary
                                            world. While many traditions and attitudes are centuries old, the lifestyle
                                            is modern and fast-paced. In today’s time, the country is among the leaders
                                            in technology and industries. Consequently, the behavior and social norms
                                            are continuously being transformed as the people balance the modern age with
                                            their cultural traditions.<br>

                                            Tourists visiting the kingdom must respect the cultural norms and try to
                                            indulge in the traditions for a wholesome experience of Saudi Arabia.</p>

                                        <h3>Saudi Arabia’s traditional dance</h3>
                                        <p>Like music, dances are also quite popular amongst the Saudi Arabian people.
                                            The country’s national dance is ardha, which is a sword dance performed by
                                            men. Originating in Saudi’s central area called Najd, Ardha is an ancient
                                            traditional dance that involves a combination of singers, a poet or a
                                            narrator, and dancers carrying swords. While performing this dance, the
                                            dancers stand in a circle or two parallel lines with a poet singing amidst
                                            them.</p>

                                        <p>1. Old trade routes<br>
                                            Back in 3,000 BC, several Arabian merchants were part of an extensive trade
                                            network extending to Egypt, the Mediterranean, and South Asia. These
                                            merchants linked the region to the Mediterranean lands and Byzantium on one
                                            side and India and the Far East on the other. On their trade routes, they
                                            brought in the essence of various cultures from around the world.<br>

                                            2. Foundation of Islam<br>
                                            In the 7th century AD, the country’s culture was further influenced by the
                                            introduction of Islam. Over a century after its introduction in the Arabian
                                            Peninsula, the religion spread to China and India in the east and the
                                            Atlantic Ocean to the west. In the Arabian region, Islam fostered a period
                                            of huge developments and learnings in the fields of science, culture, and
                                            philosophy.<br>

                                            3. Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage<br>
                                            For the past 1400 years, Muslims around the globe have traveled to the holy
                                            Saudi Arabian cities of Makkah and Madinah every year, enriching the
                                            region’s culture even further. Muslims from around the world visit these
                                            holy cities to carry out the holy pilgrimage of Hajj and Umrah which further
                                            led to the evolution of the culture in Saudi Arabia.</p>
